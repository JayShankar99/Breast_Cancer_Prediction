1. ID number
2. Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

##	Benign: These are not cancerous. They either cannot spread or grow, or they do so very slowly. 
		If a doctor removes them, they do not generally return.
##	Malignant: Malignant tumors are cancerous. The cells can grow and spread to other parts of the body.
